# Tata_Data_Visualisation_Virtual_Internship

Empowering Business with Effective Insights

This project focuses on leveraging data visualization techniques to analyze and gain insights from an online retail sales dataset using Power BI/Taleau. By employing these tools, valuable insights and analysis were communicated to empower businesses with data-driven decision-making.

Dataset:
The project utilized an online retail sales dataset frovide by Tata on Forage, which includes information on customer transactions, product details, and sales performance metrics. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of sales activities, allowing for in-depth analysis and visualization.

Project Tasks:
1) Framing Business Scenarios: Identified relevant business scenarios and formulated clear objectives for the analysis and visualization process. Considered key questions and requirements to guide the project.

2) Selecting Appropriate Visuals: Utilized Power BI and Excel to create a variety of data visualizations, including charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards. Chose visualizations that best conveyed the desired insights and facilitated clear communication. Task 2 was a quiz conductuded on the platform and therefore no files pertaning to it is added here.

3) Creating Effective Visualizations: Leveraged Power BI's interactive features and Excel's data cleaning capabilities to create visually compelling and informative graphics. Paid attention to design principles and ensured the visualizations were easy to interpret and aesthetically pleasing.

4) Communicating Valuable Insights and Analysis: Analyzed the sales dataset, identified trends, patterns, and correlations, and transformed them into actionable insights. Effectively communicated these findings through interactive dashboards, reports, and presentations, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

Visualization for the Following Questions

Question 1:
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

Question 2:
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3:
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4:
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.


I have also attached a Tableau file and a presentation to share the insights generated. The Tableau file contains interactive visualizations that allow you to explore the data in more detail. The presentation provides a summary of the findings and recommendations.
